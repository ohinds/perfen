* Features

** Backing track mode
- Follow along with a live track by comparing the audio of a key
  track to the audio of a live track
- Dynamically stretch recorded audio to match location in the key
  track
- Turn on and off effects on incoming audio
- Turn on and off sample triggers

** Loop mode (phase 2)
- Detect tempo of live track in real-time
- Allow looping of input audio
- Dynamically stretch looped audio to match detected tempo

* Modules

** Controller
- Reads config
- Instantiates modules
- Dispatches incoming audio buffer to appropriate modules
- Dispatches incoming MIDI to appropriate modules
- Updates position
- Receives processed audio from modules
- Mixes audio
- Outputs audio

** Key tracker
- Loads a key audio or MIDI track from disk
- Takes live input audio or MIDI track(s)
- Estimates the current position in the key track by matching the
  keytrack and the live track(s)
- Estimates the relative rate of the live track(s) relative to the
  keytrack
- Outputs the estimated keytrack position

** Tempo detection (phase 2)
- Takes input audio track(s)
- Estimates tempo based on spacing of peaks
- Outputs current tempo estimate

** Sampler
- Configured with a map between MIDI events and audio samples
- Takes live input MIDI
- Triggers audio samples associated with the MIDI events
- Outputs audio associated with samples

** Keytracked sampler
- Like Sampler, but:
- Loads samples that are aligned with a keytrack
- Takes position in keytrack and relative live track rate
- Stretches audio based on relative rate
- Outputs stretched audio based on position
- NOTE: care must be taken to maintain continuity between rate changes

** Keytracked effects
- Like Keytracked sampler, but:
- Loads an effect schedule that is aligned with a keytrack
- Takes in live audio track(s)
- Takes position in keytrack
- Plays out effect schedule based on keytrack position
- Applies effects to live audio
- Outputs affected audio
